# Getting Hints from AI

The Michigan Spots AI assistant is your personal treasure hunting companion, ready to provide hints and clues when you're stuck finding a spot. Here's how to make the most of this helpful feature.

## When to Ask for Hints

### Perfect Times to Use AI Hints
- **You're in the general area** but can't find the exact spot
- **The description is confusing** or uses unfamiliar terms
- **You've been searching for 10+ minutes** without success
- **The photo doesn't match** what you're seeing
- **You want to confirm** you're looking in the right place

### When to Try on Your Own First
- You just arrived at the location
- You haven't read the full description yet
- You're enjoying the challenge of discovery
- You want to earn the satisfaction of finding it yourself

## How to Ask for Hints

### Using the AI Chat
1. **Open the spot page** you're trying to find
2. **Tap the AI Helper button** (usually a chat or lightbulb icon)
3. **Ask your question** in natural language
4. **Wait for the response** and follow the guidance

### Effective Hint Requests

#### Be Specific About Your Location
❌ "I can't find this spot"
✅ "I'm standing in the parking lot of the library, but I don't see the statue mentioned in the description"

#### Describe What You See
❌ "This doesn't look right"
✅ "I see a red brick building and a fountain, but the description mentions a gazebo"

## Sample Hint Conversations

### Example 1: Historic Landmark

### Example 2: Natural Feature

### Example 3: Urban Spot
**You**: "I'm downtown but there are so many murals, which one is it?"
**AI**: "You're looking for the mural on the north wall of the coffee shop at Main and 3rd Street. It features a lighthouse and was painted in 2019."

## Making the Most of Hints

### Follow-Up Questions
Don't hesitate to ask for clarification:
- "Can you be more specific about which entrance?"
- "What if the business is closed?"
- "Is there another landmark I can use?"

### Combine Hints with Exploration
- Use hints as starting points, not complete solutions
- Look around the suggested area for additional clues
- Take time to appreciate the location once you find it
