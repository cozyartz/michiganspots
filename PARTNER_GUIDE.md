A: We offer a 14-day money-back guarantee. Plus, Featured+ partners get strategy sessions to optimize challenges. We succeed when you succeed.

**Q: Can I offer non-cash prizes?**
A: Absolutely! Gift cards, tickets, swag, experiences, services - anything with real value. Many partners find merchandise and experiences more effective than cash.

**Q: Do I need to give discounts to players?**
A: No. Players are simply discovering your business through challenges. You provide normal service. Prizes are optional add-ons.

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**
A: Monthly subscriptions can cancel anytime (no refund for current month). Quarterly/yearly are one-time payments for the duration (14-day refund window).
