<div class="prose max-w-none">
    <p class="lead">Michigan's food scene is having a moment.

    <h2>1. Detroit: America's Most Exciting Food City</h2>
    <p>Detroit's comeback story is delicious. <a href="/about" class="text-lakes-blue hover:text-copper-orange font-semibold">Discover more Michigan businesses</a> on our platform. Corktown, Midtown, and Eastern Market buzz with innovative restaurants, craft breweries, and historic eateries. Must-visits: <strong>Selden Standard</strong> (seasonal small plates), <strong>Lady of the House</strong> (nose-to-tail dining), and <strong>Takoi</strong> (Thai street food). Don't leave without trying a classic Detroit-style coney dog from Lafayette or American Coney Island—locals still debate which is better!</p>

    <h2>2. Ann Arbor: Farm-to-Table Pioneer</h2>
    <p>Ann Arbor was doing farm-to-table before it was trendy. <strong>Zingerman's Delicatessen</strong> is legendary (try the Reuben—seriously), while <strong>Zingerman's Roadhouse</strong> serves elevated comfort food with ingredients sourced within 100 miles. The Ann Arbor Farmers Market (Wednesdays and Saturdays) showcases the region's incredible agricultural bounty.</p>

    <h2>3. Traverse City: Cherry Capital & Wine Country</h2>
    <p>Traverse City isn't just cherries—though you MUST try cherry pie at <strong>Grand Traverse Pie Company</strong>. The Leelanau and Old Mission Peninsulas boast 40+ wineries, many with stunning bay views. Food highlights: <strong>Trattoria Stella</strong> (Italian in a former asylum), <strong>Mama Lu's</strong> (tacos and tequila), and <strong>Red Spire Brunch</strong> (worth the wait).</p>

    <h2>4. The Upper Peninsula: Pasty Paradise</h2>
    <p>The UP's mining heritage lives on through the pasty—a hearty meat-and-vegetable turnover that's pure comfort food. Authentic pasties from <strong>Lawry's Pasty Shop</strong> (Ishpeming) or <strong>Muldoon's Pasties</strong> (Munising) are mandatory. Pair with a local craft beer and you've experienced UP culture at its finest. Bonus: Try whitefish from Lake Superior—it's incredibly fresh and delicious!</p>

    <h2>5. Grand Rapids: Craft Beer Capital of Michigan</h2>
    <p>With 80+ breweries, Grand Rapids earns its "Beer City USA" title. <strong>Founders Brewing</strong>, <strong>New Holland</strong>, and <strong>Brewery Vivant</strong> lead the pack, but don't skip smaller gems like <strong>Aperitivo</strong> and <strong>Harmony Hall</strong>. Food scene standouts: <strong>The Sovengard</strong> (Scandinavian), <strong>San Chez</strong> (tapas), and <strong>Reserve Wine & Food</strong> (upscale American).</p>
