    <p class="lead">Ready to start your <a href="/" class="text-lakes-blue hover:text-copper-orange font-semibold">Michigan Spots</a> adventure? Whether you're geocaching in the Upper Peninsula or exploring hidden beaches along Lake Michigan, having the right gear makes all the difference. Here's your essential checklist for Michigan outdoor adventures!</p>

    <h2>1. Navigation & GPS</h2>
    <p>First things first: you need reliable navigation. While your phone works great, having a backup GPS device can be a game-changer, especially in areas with spotty cell coverage in the UP or remote state parks.</p>

It's rugged, waterproof, and has excellent battery life for multi-day Michigan adventures.</p>
      <p class="text-xs text-ink-secondary italic mt-2">Pro tip: Download Michigan trail maps before you go. Many state parks have poor cell reception!</p>

    <h2>2. Hydration Solutions</h2>
    <p>Michigan summers can be hot and humid, especially on exposed dunes or open trails. A quality hydration pack keeps you refreshed without having to constantly stop and dig through your backpack. You'll drink more water when it's easily accessible!</p>

    <h2>3. Weather-Ready Clothing</h2>
    <p>Anyone who lives in Michigan knows: if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes. A lightweight, packable rain jacket is essential year-round. Great Lakes weather patterns change rapidly, especially near the coast.</p>
