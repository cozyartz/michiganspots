Whether you're shooting with a DSLR or smartphone, these spots will fill your portfolio with Pure Michigan magic.</p>

    <h2>1. Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore: Rainbow Cliffs & Waterfalls</h2>

    <p><strong>Best time:</strong> Late afternoon for warm cliff glow | <strong>Season:</strong> Summer for boat access, winter for ice formations</p>

    <p>Towering sandstone cliffs striped with minerals create nature's own abstract art. Miners Castle, Chapel Rock, and Spray Falls offer iconic compositions.</p>

    <p>Take a boat tour for water-level perspectives, or hike the North Country Trail for clifftop views. Winter transforms waterfalls into stunning ice sculptures—bring your tripod!</p>

      <p class="text-sm text-ink-secondary mb-3">Serious about landscape photography? A <a href="https://amzn.to/3Lv37jX" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" class="text-lakes-blue hover:text-copper-orange underline">smartphone camera lens kit</a> transforms your phone into a professional tool.

      <p class="text-xs text-ink-secondary italic mt-2">Long exposures are key for smooth waterfall shots. A sturdy portable tripod is essential—especially for low-light sunrise/sunset photography!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>2. Sleeping Bear Dunes: Golden Hour Heaven</h2>

    <p><strong>Best time:</strong> Sunrise from Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive overlooks | <strong>Season:</strong> Fall colors (late Sept-early Oct)</p>

    <p>Voted "Most Beautiful Place in America" for good reason! The Dune Climb, Empire Bluffs, and Pierce Stocking overlooks offer epic Lake Michigan vistas.</p>

    <p>Autumn transforms the landscape into a painter's palette—reds, oranges, and yellows against brilliant blue water. Plan sunrise shoots for dramatic light and zero crowds.</p>

    <h2>3. Tahquamenon Falls: Michigan's Niagara</h2>

    <p><strong>Best time:</strong> Spring runoff (April-May) for maximum water volume | <strong>Season:</strong> Fall for color, winter for ice</p>

    <p>The Upper Peninsula's star waterfall cascades 50 feet with distinctive amber water (tannins from cedar swamps). The viewing platform offers classic compositions, while trails lead to unique angles.</p>

    <p>Winter photography here is otherworldly—frozen curtains of ice and snow-covered surroundings create ethereal scenes.</p>

    <h2>4. Mackinac Bridge: Engineering Marvel Photography</h2>

    <p><strong>Best time:</strong> Blue hour (twilight) for bridge lights | <strong>Season:</strong> Year-round, but fall colors add drama</p>

    <p>The "Mighty Mac" connects Michigan's peninsulas and photographer's imaginations! Shoot from Mackinaw City for Mackinac Island backdrops, or from St. Ignace for sunset compositions.</p>

    <p>Bridge Walk Day (Labor Day) offers once-a-year pedestrian access for unique perspectives. Winter fog creates moody, atmospheric shots.</p>

    <h2>5. Detroit: Urban Architecture & Street Art</h2>

    <p><strong>Best time:</strong> Early morning for empty streets, golden hour for building glow | <strong>Season:</strong> Year-round</p>

    <p>The Guardian Building's Art Deco interior is a photographer's dream (free admission!). Eastern Market's massive murals provide vibrant street art backdrops.</p>

    <p>Belle Isle's James Scott Memorial Fountain, Michigan Central Station, and Fisher Building offer architectural variety. Shoot on weekdays to avoid crowds at popular spots.</p>

    <p><strong>Best time:</strong> Sunrise for dramatic light | <strong>Season:</strong> Summer for kayak access</p>

    <p>Michigan's most Instagram-famous rock formation! This unique "turnip" sits just offshore in Lake Huron.</p>

    <p>Access requires kayaking from Port Austin (2.5 miles)—bring a waterproof camera case! The rock's distinctive shape creates instantly recognizable compositions. Clear summer days offer the bluest water for stunning contrast.</p>

    <h2>8. Holland: Tulip Time & Windmill Island</h2>

    <h2>9. Lighthouse Trail: Michigan's 129 Lighthouses</h2>

    <p><strong>Best shots:</strong> Big Red (Holland), Point Betsie, Crisp Point, Old Mackinac Point | <strong>Season:</strong> Storm days for dramatic waves</p>

    <p>Michigan boasts more lighthouses than any other state! Each offers unique character and settings.</p>

    <p>Storm photography at lakeside lighthouses creates dramatic images with crashing waves. Golden hour makes red lighthouses glow brilliantly. Winter ice formations around lighthouses produce otherworldly scenes.</p>

    <h2>10. Porcupine Mountains: Wilderness Vistas</h2>

    <p><strong>Best time:</strong> Late September for peak fall colors | <strong>Season:</strong> Fall (color), winter (snow), summer (wildflowers)</p>

    <p>America's least-visited national park rewards adventurous photographers! Moose encounters, pristine lakes, rugged coastlines, and zero light pollution for incredible night sky photography.</p>

    <p>This is a multi-day commitment—plan 3-5 days minimum. Backpacking photographers will find endless compositions and zero crowds.</p>

    <h2>12. Grand Sable Dunes: Desert Meets Great Lakes</h2>
    <p><strong>Best time:</strong> Sunset for dune shadows and Lake Superior glow | <strong>Season:</strong> Summer for beach access</p>
    <p>Massive perched sand dunes overlook Lake Superior's cobalt blue water—an unusual and stunning combination! The 5-mile beach hike from Grand Marais is challenging but rewarding.

    <h2>Photography Tips for Michigan Locations</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-ink-secondary">
      <li><strong>Golden Hour:</strong> 1 hour after sunrise, 1 hour before sunset for best natural light</li>
      <li><strong>Weather Apps:</strong> Dark Sky, UAV Forecast for cloud predictions and golden hour times</li>
      <li><strong>Permits:</strong> Most locations are free, but some (Isle Royale, Pictured Rocks backcountry) require permits</li>
