    <h2>Winter Safety Essentials</h2>
    <p><strong>Before you head out, always:</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-ink-secondary">
      <li>Check weather forecasts (Lake Superior generates intense squalls)</li>
      <li>Tell someone your plans and expected return time</li>
      <li>Pack emergency supplies: hand warmers, extra food, first aid kit</li>
      <li>Download offline maps (cell service is spotty in remote areas)</li>
      <li>Dress in layers with moisture-wicking base layers</li>
      <li>Bring more water than you think—winter dehydration is real!</li>
    </ul>

      <strong>Weather Reality Check:</strong> December-February temperatures range from 15-35°F in Lower Michigan, 0-25°F in the UP. Wind chills can be brutal near the Great Lakes. Dress for conditions 10 degrees colder than forecast.
    </p>

    <p class="text-sm text-ink-secondary italic mt-4">
      <strong>Beginner Tip:</strong> New to winter activities? Start with snowshoeing at state parks near metro areas (Pinckney, Highland, Maybury). Work up to remote UP adventures after building skills and testing your gear.
