## **Technical Implementation: Multi-Subreddit Support**

### **1. Subreddit Configuration System**

```typescript
// Multi-subreddit configuration
interface SubredditConfig {
  name: string;
  displayName: string;
  region: string;
  businessCategories: string[];
  customChallenges: boolean;
  moderationLevel: 'strict' | 'moderate' | 'relaxed';
  aiPersonalization: {
    localContext: string;
    culturalFactors: string[];
    seasonalEvents: string[];
  };
}

const subredditConfigs: Record<string, SubredditConfig> = {
  'michiganspots': {
    name: 'michiganspots',
    displayName: 'Michigan Spots',
    region: 'michigan_statewide',
    businessCategories: ['restaurant', 'retail', 'entertainment', 'services'],
    customChallenges: true,
    moderationLevel: 'moderate',
    aiPersonalization: {
      localContext: 'Michigan state pride, Great Lakes culture',
      culturalFactors: ['automotive_heritage', 'outdoor_recreation', 'craft_beer'],
      seasonalEvents: ['summer_festivals', 'fall_colors', 'winter_sports'],
    },
  },
  'detroit': {
    name: 'detroit',
    displayName: 'Detroit Spots',
    region: 'detroit_metro',
    businessCategories: ['restaurant', 'retail', 'entertainment', 'automotive'],
    customChallenges: true,
    moderationLevel: 'moderate',
    aiPersonalization: {
      localContext: 'Motor City pride, urban renaissance',
      culturalFactors: ['automotive_history', 'music_heritage', 'sports_culture'],
      seasonalEvents: ['auto_show', 'music_festivals', 'sports_seasons'],
    },
  },
};
```

### **2. Cross-Subreddit Challenge Sharing**

```typescript
// Enable challenges to be shared across related subreddits
interface CrossSubredditChallenge {
  originalSubreddit: string;
  targetSubreddits: string[];
  adaptationRules: {
    titleModification?: string;
    descriptionAdditions?: string[];
    localContext?: string;
  };
}

async function shareChallenge(
  challenge: Challenge,
  targetSubreddits: string[]
): Promise<void> {
  for (const subreddit of targetSubreddits) {
    const config = subredditConfigs[subreddit];
    const adaptedChallenge = await aiService.adaptChallengeForSubreddit(
      challenge,
      config
    );
    
    await publishChallengeToSubreddit(adaptedChallenge, subreddit);
  }
}
```

### **3. Regional Business Integration**

```typescript
// Automatically detect and integrate businesses by region
interface RegionalBusinessData {
  subreddit: string;
  businesses: Array<{
    name: string;
    category: string;
    location: { lat: number; lng: number };
    subredditRelevance: number;
  }>;
}

async function discoverRegionalBusinesses(
  subreddit: string
): Promise<RegionalBusinessData> {
  const config = subredditConfigs[subreddit];
  
  // Use AI to identify businesses relevant to this subreddit
  const businesses = await aiService.identifyLocalBusinesses({
    region: config.region,
    categories: config.businessCategories,
    communityPreferences: await getCommunityPreferences(subreddit),
  });
  
  return {
    subreddit,
    businesses: businesses.map(b => ({
      ...b,
      subredditRelevance: calculateRelevanceScore(b, config),
    })),
  };
}
