GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works,
such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.

"You" means the licensee, or if applicable, the legal entity exercising rights
under this License.

"Modify" means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion
requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.

"Covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

"Propagate" means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you
directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law.

"Convey" means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or
receive copies.

"Remote Network Interaction" means connecting to the covered work through a
computer network.

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on
the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under
any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright
treaty adopted on 20 December 1996.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it,
in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each
copy an appropriate copyright notice.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it
from the Program, in source code form under the terms of section 4, provided that
you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving
   a relevant date.

b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this
   License and any conditions added under section 7.

c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who
   comes into possession of a copy.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4
and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source.

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by
making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under
this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of
the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a
consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not
require acceptance.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license
from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work.

11. Patents.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the
Program or a work on which the Program is based.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you that contradict the conditions of this License,
they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.

13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program,
your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely
through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity
to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or
customary means of facilitating copying of software.

This Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any work
covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant
to the following paragraph.

14. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU
Affero General Public License from time to time.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be
given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply
local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability
in connection with the Program.
